# Configuration and Ignore Options

## Overview
Olympix tools can be configured using a JSON file at the root of your repository. This allows you to fine-tune the analysis by ignoring specific vulnerabilities, files, or paths, and by marking certain contracts, variables, and paths as "trusted."

## File Structure
The `olympix-config.json` file follows the structure below. All paths should be relative to the project root.

```json
{
    "IgnoredVulnerabilities" : {
        "<DETECTOR-SLUG>" : {
            "<FILENAME>" : [<LINE_NUM>, ...]
        }, ...
    },
    "IgnoredPaths" : [
        "<PATH_PATTERN>",
        ...
    ],
    "TrustedVariables": {
        "<DETECTOR-SLUG>" : {
            "<FILENAME>" : [<LINE_NUM>, ...]
        }, ...
    },
    "TrustedContracts": {
        "<DETECTOR-SLUG>" : ["<CONTRACT_NAME>", ...]
    },
    "TrustedPaths": [
        "<PATH_PATTERN>",
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Key Explanations
* **`IgnoredVulnerabilities`**: A dictionary to ignore specific vulnerability types.
    * **`<DETECTOR-SLUG>`**: The unique identifier for the vulnerability (e.g., `reentrancy`). You can get a list of all slugs by running the `olympix show-vulnerabilities` command.
    * **`<FILENAME>`**: The path to the file containing the vulnerability.
    * **`[<LINE_NUM>, ...]`**: An array of line numbers in that file to ignore for that specific vulnerability.

* **`IgnoredPaths`**: An array of filepaths or directory paths to completely exclude from the analysis. The analyzer will ignore any file path that starts with one of the provided patterns.

* **`TrustedPaths`**: An array of filepaths that should be considered trusted. This can help reduce the severity or number of reported issues from known safe code, such as audited third-party libraries.

* **`TrustedVariables`**: A dictionary used to mark specific variables (at specific lines) as trusted for a given check. This is particularly useful for silencing findings like `unfuzzed-variables` where a variable is intentionally left in a certain state. The structure is identical to `IgnoredVulnerabilities`. This applies to the following detectors:

    - `unfuzzed-local-variables`
    - `unfuzzed-state-variables`
    - `low-level-call-params-verified`
    - `uninitialized-local-storage`
    - `uninitialized-state-variable`
    - `unused-state-variable`

* **`TrustedContracts`**: A dictionary used to mark entire contracts as trusted for a specific detector. This is useful when a contract's design is known to be safe against a particular vulnerability (e.g., a contract that is non-reentrant by design). This applies to the following detectors:

    - `unchecked-token-transfer`
    - `reentrancy`
    - `low-level-call-params-verified`
    - `oracle-manipulation`
    - `delegatecall-in-loop`
    - `arbitrary-delegatecall`
    - `calls-in-loop`
    - `external-call-potential-out-of-gas`
    - `call-without-gas-budget`
    - `arbitrary-transfer-from`
    - `function-selector-clash`
    - `unchecked-low-level`
    - `reentrancy-events`
    - `unused-return-function-call`

## Example
Here is an example `olympix-config.json` file demonstrating how to use the different options:

```json
{
  "IgnoredVulnerabilities": {
    "reentrancy" : {
      "src/reentrancy/CEI.sol" : [21]
    },
    "locked-ether": {
      "src/reentrancy/CEILib.sol" : [32]
    }
  },
  "TrustedVariables": {
    "unfuzzed-variables" : {
      "src/unfuzzed-state-variables/main.sol" : [5]
    }
  },
  "TrustedContracts": {
    "reentrancy" : ["ChecksEffectsInteractionsNamespacedLibContract"]
  },
  "IgnoredPaths": ["src/signature-replay/"],
  "TrustedPaths": ["src/low-level-call-parameters-verified/"]
}
```

### info
- The configuration file **must** be located at the **workspace root**.
- It supports multiple detector slugs, files, contracts, and line numbers.
- The settings apply **across all Olympix tools**.

## Usage
To use these features, ensure that:

1.  The `olympix-config.json`
2.  The specified detector slugs, filenames, and line numbers match the vulnerability reports.

## Note

The original `.olympix-ignore.json` file is still supported for ignoring vulnerabilities and paths.

If both files are present, their configurations will be merged. The tools will recognize any of these filenames at your project's root:

* `olympix-config.json`
* `.olympix-config.json`
* `olympix-ignore.json`
* `.olympix-ignore.json`

!!! Warning
    Be **extra-confident** before disabling any vulnerabilities, as this could allow bugs to silently pass into productionâ€”bugs that might not even exist yet. Ignoring vulnerabilities should only be done after a thorough review to ensure that it does not introduce security risks in the future.
